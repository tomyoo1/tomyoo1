# Hello, I'm Tom Yoo

I am a beginner engineer who is studying software living in Korea.

I'm trying to code hard.
It's my first time writing this letter of introduction, so I'm not good at it, but I'm planning to update it again within this year.

Learning languages include Java, Python, Oracle, MySQL, and C, but I try to focus on Python languages.

I made a simple sales site.
Also, I'm trying to update it in a cool way little by little.
